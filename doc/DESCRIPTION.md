The Fipamo project was born from a need for a simple, easy to use no data blog platform that doesnâ€™t require much effort to set up and maintain. Fipamo uses Markdown to handle posts and renders them to flat html so you can serve them from anywhere. No complicated set ups. No long list of dependencies. Just write and publish.
